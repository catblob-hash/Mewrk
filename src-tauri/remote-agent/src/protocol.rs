//! The wire protocol between the host and the agent on a remote machine.
//!
//! One byte stream carries everything — requests, replies, heartbeats and the
//! output of every process the agent runs for the host — so a machine costs one
//! SSH connection however much is happening on it. The stream is a sequence of
//! frames:
//!
//! ```text
//! u32 BE header length | u32 BE body length | header (JSON) | body (raw bytes)
//! ```
//!
//! The header is a [`Message`]; the body is whatever bytes the message is about
//! (process output, process input, a script's standard input) and travels
//! without any encoding, so a binary file or a terminal's escape sequences cost
//! exactly their own size.
//!
//! # Surviving a dropped link
//!
//! The link is expected to drop — a laptop sleeps, Wi-Fi changes, a tunnel
//! restarts — and nothing the agent runs may be lost or done twice because of
//! it. Two rules make a reconnect invisible:
//!
//! * **Every request is idempotent under retransmission.** A request the host
//!   sent but got no reply to is sent again, with the same id, on the next
//!   connection. [`Op::Spawn`] is keyed by the session id the host chose, so a
//!   second copy finds the first session instead of starting another process;
//!   signals, resizes and releases do the same thing however many times they
//!   arrive.
//! * **Every byte stream is addressed by offset.** Output frames carry the
//!   offset of their first byte in the session's stream, and the host resumes a
//!   connection by saying which offset it has reached ([`ResumePoint`]). Input
//!   runs the other way on the same rule: [`SessionInfo::input_end`] tells the
//!   host how much input already arrived, and it re-sends only the rest.
