//! Windows: the cell runs through srt-win, the Windows backend of Anthropic's
//! sandbox-runtime (vendored under `src-tauri/vendor/srt-win`, Apache-2.0),
//! shipped beside the agent as `srt-win.exe`.
//!
//! Windows has no unprivileged sandbox that can both fence the network and
//! keep a process out of the account's files, so srt-win uses another
//! account: a hidden local user, created once with administrator rights
//! (`srt-win install`, one UAC prompt), whose processes it starts under a
//! restricted token — administrators and the logon session disabled, no
//! privileges, medium integrity — in a kill-on-close job on a private
//! desktop. Windows Filtering Platform filters keyed on that account's SID
//! block every connection it makes except to a few loopback ports, where the
//! agent runs the proxy that applies the network policy. Which ports is
//! chosen at install — 60080–60089 unless the installing program said
//! otherwise — so the agent asks srt-win to find them by trying them as that
//! account (`wfp ports`) rather than assume them.
//!
//! Files follow from the account: it cannot read the user's profile at all,
//! so credentials are out of reach without a rule of their own. The agent
//! grants it what the cell needs — the workspaces and the cell's own
//! directories to write, the agent and the user's tool directories on `PATH`
//! to read — and denies, per cell, what in the workspaces runs outside the
//! sandbox later.
//!
//! srt-win's install state is machine-wide and shared with any other program
//! that uses it (Claude Code does): an existing install is reused, whoever
//! made it, and Mewrk never uninstalls one.
