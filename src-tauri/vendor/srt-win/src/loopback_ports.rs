//! Mewrk: which loopback ports the WFP fence lets the sandbox user reach
//! (`srt-win wfp ports`), found by trying them as that user.
//!
//! The range is chosen at install (`--proxy-port-range`) and recorded only in
//! the filters' tags, which a non-elevated caller cannot enumerate. The
//! install is machine-wide and shared, and whichever program made it — or
//! replaced it with `--force` — may have chosen a range of its own, so a
//! program that runs its proxy for the sandbox asks here rather than
//! assuming the default.
//!
//! Each port is tried by listening on it and connecting to it: the fence
//! refuses the connect with WSAEACCES at `ALE_AUTH_CONNECT`, before any
//! packet, and otherwise it completes at once. The search starts in the
//! default range, where an install normally has it, and walks outward from
//! the first port that connects; only when none there does is every other
//! port tried.
