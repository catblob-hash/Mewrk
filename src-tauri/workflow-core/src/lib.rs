//! Engine-independent workflow decision boundary.
//!
//! This crate contains workflow decisions for cache-key chains ([`chain`]),
//! boundary cloning ([`boundary`]), progress merging ([`progress`]), and
//! structured output ([`schema`]). Script engines and host runtimes supply
//! values through [`StepSource`].
//!
//! Dependencies are intentionally limited to serde, serde_json, and sha2. Adding
//! an engine dependency here would couple decision logic back to that engine.
