//! The conversation's history: one ordered, append-only record the host keeps of
//! everything that happened to a conversation.
//!
//! The timeline is the user's to edit. It says what the conversation holds now,
//! not what happened: a card can be rewritten, deleted, or written by hand as if
//! the model had said it. So whenever the host needs to know what actually
//! happened — whether a result reached the model, what an agent last said, which
//! script an approved dispatch ran — it reads this record instead, and so does the
//! history pane.
//!
//! One record rather than one ledger per direction, because the questions cut
//! across directions. What a call ran with is neither what the model sent (a
//! `PreToolUse` hook may rewrite it, and that rewrite is intended) nor what the
//! next request replays (the timeline's projection of it). Whether an agent's last
//! reply was its final one depends on what came after it — another request, or a
//! `Stop` hook that sent it back to work. Only a single sequence can answer "what
//! came after", so every kind of entry shares one `seq` per conversation:
//!
//! - `request` — a payload put on the wire ([`RequestRecorder::record`]),
//!   immediately before the submit, so a request the transport then loses still
//!   leaves one. Bodies are content-addressed: every round re-sends the whole
//!   history, and storing each verbatim would grow with the square of the
//!   conversation.
//! - `response` — what the model sent back, as the host parsed it, with the usage
//!   the provider reported ([`RequestRecorder::record_response`]). Written before
//!   the host acts on it and waited for.
//! - `hook` — what each hook decided: a block, a halt, a permission, a rewritten
//!   input, an added context ([`record_hooks`]). Written before the decision takes
//!   effect and waited for.
//! - `tool` — the input a call actually runs with, once hooks and approval have had
//!   their say ([`record_tool_call`]). Written before it runs and waited for: this,
//!   not the model's words, is what a later check compares against.
//! - `result` — what a call returned, as the model is handed it
//!   ([`record_tool_result`]).
//! - `edit` / `run` — changes to the trunk timeline, recorded by the store itself in
//!   the transaction that made them: what the user changed, and what a run settled.
//!
//! A child run — a subagent, a workflow step — shares its parent's conversation id
//! and so its store row, and its entries are told apart by `owner`, the name the
//! child was spawned under (see [`owner_of`]).
//!
//! Recording never fails a run and never adds latency to a provider call: entries
//! go to a single background writer through a bounded queue. The entries that
//! recovery reads as evidence are the exception to "never wait" — the request
//! thread waits for them to reach disk, briefly, so a process that dies right after
//! the host acted still left a record of what it acted on.
