//! The `# Environment` section of the system prompt.
//!
//! One block naming the facts a model cannot discover without spending a tool
//! call: where it is running, whether that directory is a Git checkout, which
//! other workspaces it may act in and on which machines, and what host it is on.
//! Claude Code publishes a similar block, and the wording follows it so a model
//! trained against that phrasing reads ours the same way.
//!
//! The workspace list is the one part that is Mewrk's own. A conversation can
//! work in directories on more than one machine, and the number in front of each
//! is the address a tool call uses: it is the only thing that selects a machine,
//! so the list has to be stated before the first call, not discovered from an
//! error afterwards.
//!
//! What is deliberately absent: the shell, the model's own name and id, and the
//! knowledge cutoff. Mewrk exposes `bash` and `powershell` as separate tools, so
//! naming a shell here would contradict the catalog; the model identity and the
//! cutoff are the provider's to know, and repeating a guess at them in the prompt
//! only creates a second, staler source of truth.
//!
//! Every line is a profile key, so a translated profile translates the block.
//! Paths arrive from the host's own records rather than from the model, but they
//! are still user-supplied text: [`sanitize_path`] strips the control and
//! bidirectional characters that could make a rendered line read as something
//! other than what it is.
