//! Canonical timeline to AI SDK `ModelMessage[]`.
//!
//! This is the second stage of the `wire_history` projection. The first stage,
//! [`crate::wire_history::canonical_history`], folds editable `ContextItem`s into
//! provider-neutral `CanonicalHistoryBlock`s shared by editing, folds, and branch
//! replay. This stage renders the sole remaining form; the sidecar lets AI SDK
//! translate it for each provider.
//!
//! The shape follows installed `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` type definitions because
//! documentation may diverge from the installed `ai@7` types.
//!
//! User messages carry host-owned placeholders instead of attachment content:
//! an `ImagePart` whose `image` is an image placeholder, and a
//! `{ type: "mewrk-file", file: FileAttachment }` part per attached file.
//! `aisdk::step` hydrates both after taking the wire-ledger copy, so the ledger
//! and the incremental projection cache never hold base64 or file text; the
//! file parts become text parts (or plain string content), which is the only
//! form every provider family — the text-only `claude-agent` transcript
//! included — accepts for a document.
//!
//! ```text
//! user      { role, content: string | Array<TextPart | ImagePart | FilePart> }
//! assistant { role, content: string | Array<TextPart | … | ToolCallPart | ToolResultPart> }
//! tool      { role, content: Array<ToolResultPart> }
//!
//! ToolCallPart   { type: "tool-call",   toolCallId, toolName, input }
//! ToolResultPart { type: "tool-result", toolCallId, toolName, output: ToolResultOutput }
//! ToolResultOutput = { type: "text", value } | { type: "error-text", value } | …
