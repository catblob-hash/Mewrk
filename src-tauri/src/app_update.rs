//! In-app updates sourced from GitHub Releases and their download mirror.
//!
//! Mewrk has no update server. A release is a GitHub Release tagged `v<version>` that carries
//! the NSIS installer (`*-setup.exe`), the portable archive (`*_portable.zip`) and, optionally,
//! a `SHA256SUMS` file (written by `scripts/release-assets.mjs`). This module is the client
//! half: check, download, verify, hand off. Every decision that leads to a file write or a
//! process launch is a pure function here so it can be tested; the Tauri commands in `lib.rs`
//! only wire them to the app handle.
//!
//! Every release is also copied, byte for byte, to [`MIRROR_ORIGIN`] (`scripts/release-mirror.mjs`
//! uploads a file only when it matches GitHub's digest and `SHA256SUMS`). The mirror is a
//! Cloudflare R2 bucket, reachable where GitHub's asset CDN is slow or blocked. A download tries
//! it first and falls back to GitHub; the update check asks GitHub's API first and reads the
//! mirror's `latest.json` only when the API cannot answer, so a mirror that stopped updating can
//! never hide a newer release.
//!
//! Trust model: TLS to the origin is the integrity anchor, exactly as when a user downloads from
//! the release page by hand. Both origins are the publisher's own. Each download is checked
//! against the `SHA256SUMS` from the same origin, which catches a corrupt or truncated transfer,
//! not a compromised account. There is no signature scheme. Whatever the renderer hands back, the
//! host only ever fetches this repository's canonical release paths and their mirror copies.
//!
//! Installer hand-off mirrors tauri-plugin-updater: the downloaded NSIS installer is started
//! through `ShellExecuteW` with `/P /UPDATE /R` (passive UI, keep user data and shortcuts,
//! relaunch afterwards) and the running app exits so the installer can replace it.
//!
//! Only the Windows installer and portable editions download anything: every other edition
//! still runs the check and learns the latest version and its release page, but the check
//! selects no asset for it ([`InstallFlavor::downloads_updates`]) and a download request is
//! refused before any directory is touched. That is the macOS app (the next `.dmg` is on the
//! release page) and an MSIX installed from the release page (so is the next `.msix`).
//!
//! An MSIX installed from the Microsoft Store ([`InstallFlavor::StoreMsix`]) never checks here at
//! all: the Store updates it, and its policy forbids a Store app updating itself.
