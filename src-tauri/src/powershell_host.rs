//! PowerShell setup for the two host surfaces that are *not* the `powershell`
//! tool: the interactive terminal and hook execution.
//!
//! The `powershell` tool matches Claude Code byte for byte, and Claude Code
//! prepends only three statements (`Out-File:Encoding`, `$OutputEncoding`, and
//! `$PSStyle.OutputRendering`). That is deliberately weaker than what these two
//! surfaces need, so they keep the stricter setup that lives here rather than
//! sharing the tool's script.
//!
//! Hooks are the clearer case. A hook receives UTF-8 JSON on stdin and its
//! stdout is parsed back as UTF-8 JSON. Windows PowerShell encodes a redirected
//! pipe with the OEM code page, so all three `[Console]` encodings have to be
//! pinned together: today the two errors cancel out — the hook reads UTF-8 as
//! GBK and writes it back as GBK — and fixing only the output side would turn
//! that accidental round-trip into visible corruption.
//!
//! The terminal is the other. It runs a real PTY the user reads directly, so
//! the file cmdlets' encoding defaults are part of the surface being offered
//! rather than of any tool contract.
//!
//! Nothing here widens the console. A hidden console is 120 columns and the
//! formatter pads every row of a table out to that width; widening it to
//! thousands of columns turns a seven-file `Get-ChildItem` into hundreds of
//! kilobytes of spaces, which is only tolerable with a trimmer on the capture
//! path. The shell tool no longer trims — Claude Code returns the bytes as they
//! came — so the widening it used to pay for went with it.

/// File cmdlets that read or write with an encoding default of their own.

/// Windows PowerShell 5.1 decodes a BOM-less file with the ANSI code page — so
/// `Get-Content` on a UTF-8 source turns every CJK line into mojibake, and an
/// invalid trailing byte pair swallows the newline after it, gluing the next
/// line onto the same one — while its writers disagree with each other:
/// `Set-Content` writes ANSI, `Out-File` and `>` write UTF-16, `Export-Csv`
/// writes ASCII. The list is enumerated rather than `*` because a cmdlet whose
/// `-Encoding` takes a `System.Text.Encoding` object (`Send-MailMessage`) would
