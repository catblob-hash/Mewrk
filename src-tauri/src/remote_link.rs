//! Reaching an SSH machine through the agent Mewrk keeps running there.
//!
//! Every SSH machine a conversation uses is served by one long-lived link
//! ([`remote_agent::client::Link`]): a single `ssh` process whose channel
//! carries every command, terminal, file operation and heartbeat for that
//! machine, to a daemon that outlives the connection. Before this, each of
//! those was its own `ssh` process, run by whatever login shell the account
//! had, and ended by any hiccup in the network.
//!
//! This module is the host's half of that arrangement:
//!
//! * [`SshLauncher`] starts the transport. The login shell is only asked to
//!   start the agent's proxy — one fixed line every Unix shell, Git Bash
//!   included, reads the same way ([`crate::remote_shell::posix_line`]), or on
//!   a Windows machine whose login shell is `cmd.exe` or PowerShell, a
//!   PowerShell script sent encoded ([`crate::remote_shell::powershell_line`])
//!   — and when the agent is not there yet, the launcher uploads the build for
//!   the machine's platform and checks that it runs before using it.
//! * [`link_for`] hands out the link for a runner, starting it on first use and
//!   remembering machines the agent cannot serve (a platform with no build, a
//!   home it cannot write to), which keep using the per-command transport in
//!   [`crate::run_environment`].
//! * [`run_script`], [`spawn`] and friends are the shapes the rest of the host
//!   already speaks — a script's output, a child process — so callers change
//!   where a process runs, not how they talk to it.
//!
//! The daemon reclaims what a vanished host leaves behind; the host, for its
//! part, ends its links with a release on a normal exit ([`shutdown`]), so a
//! quit application leaves nothing running on any machine.
