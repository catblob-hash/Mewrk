//! Per-card proof that a tool result came from this application's own
//! execution rather than from the renderer.
//!
//! # Why this is not a receipt book
//!
//! The original design kept a process-local `HashMap` of every executed
//! payload and asked, at save time, whether the card being saved was in it.
//! That map is bounded (512 entries), lives only in memory, and is keyed by the
//! full serialized payload. Each of those three properties turned an ordinary
//! session into an unusable app:
//!
//! - **Bounded**: past 512 tool calls the oldest entries were evicted, so a
//!   card that had not been saved yet could lose its proof to unrelated later
//!   activity.
//! - **In memory**: a restart discarded every proof. Anything executed but not
//!   yet persisted could never be saved again.
//! - **Keyed by payload bytes**: any difference at all between the bytes the
//!   host attested and the bytes the renderer returned — a float that crossed
//!   JavaScript, a re-serialized object, a field the renderer rebuilt — meant
//!   no match, and the mismatch was permanent because the card kept coming back.
//!
//! A token inverts that. The host computes a MAC over the card's meaning and
//! hands it to the renderer *with* the card; the renderer stores it like any
//! other field and returns it on save; the host recomputes the MAC and compares.
//! Nothing has to be remembered between the execution and the save, so there is
//! no capacity to exhaust and nothing a restart can lose. The proof travels
//! with the thing it proves.
//!
//! # What the token commits to
//!
//! The MAC covers exactly what must not change after execution: the owning
//! conversation, the card's identity, the tool, its executed and requested
//! input, the result, and the complete recursive child record. It deliberately
//! does *not* cover the workspace path — a workspace can be renamed or moved on
//! disk without any of the above changing meaning — nor timestamps that the
//! host itself rewrites.
//!
//! # The key
//!
//! One random key per app-data directory, stored beside the document. It is not
//! a user secret and does not protect against someone who can read the data
//! directory: anyone with that access can edit the document itself. It exists
//! to stop the *renderer* — which is the untrusted party here — from writing a
//! tool result the host never produced. Losing the key is survivable: cards
//! attested under it stop verifying and are quarantined, exactly as if they had
//! been tampered with, and everything else still saves.
