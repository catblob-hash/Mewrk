//! Registry of `bash` / `powershell` tool calls, running and finished.
//!
//! A shell command's runtime is unpredictable: `npm install`, a test suite, and `ls` all arrive
//! through the same tool. Before this registry existed the model round simply blocked inside
//! `wait_timeout` with nothing visible anywhere — the user could see neither that a command was
//! running nor what it was, and the only way to stop it was to cancel the whole model run.
//!
//! So every spawned shell registers here. Registration is what makes it a *task*: it appears in the
//! task sidebar, it carries the command text so the row says something useful, and while it runs it
//! can be killed on its own without touching the run.
//!
//! A command that ends is **retained**, not dropped: its entry keeps its start, gains an end and an
//! outcome, and the row moves into the sidebar's collapsed "finished" section. That is the whole
//! point of a task list — the user's question after a build is "did it pass", and a row that
//! deletes itself the instant it could answer that never gets to. Retention is bounded per
//! conversation so a long session cannot grow the list without limit.
//!
//! The registry owns no threads. The tool call still blocks its own worker thread — that is what
//! the model's turn means — but it polls for a stop request instead of sleeping on the child, and
//! the process tree dies the moment one arrives.
