//! Automatic handoff: what the composer's "auto-compact" switch does.
//!
//! Nothing is summarized on the model's behalf. When a top-level conversation's
//! context crosses the threshold the user set, the run loop *arms* it: the host
//! asks the model to hand off — an instruction, so by the carrier the model has
//! for one (`host_append::instruction_carrier`): an appended system prompt
//! where the model and endpoint take a system message mid-conversation, and
//! otherwise a host message in the conversation's container, the form every
//! host notice takes — and from that step on it offers four tools it derives for
//! itself, as it derives the plan tools from the security level —
//!
//! - `create_handoff_note`, `edit_handoff_note` and `read_handoff_note`, the
//!   memory tools' shape pointed at a notebook of the conversation's own under
//!   the app data directory (`handoffs/<conversation id>/`), where no file tool
//!   reaches and no other conversation writes;
//! - `handoff`, which takes no arguments. It opens the continuation — a new
//!   conversation, not a fork of this one — starts its first run, and ends
//!   this one.
//!
//! The continuation inherits the conversation's system prompt and nothing of its
//! history: the system prompt the user gave it (its timeline's first context,
//! when that is a system card of the user's — usually the preset's; one
//! anywhere else counts for nothing), the settings — hence the same tools and
//! the same host-assembled system prompt — and a copy of the notebook. It inherits
//! none of the cache state: the settings arrive without the tool lock, since
//! the cache that lock describes rode on the history left behind, and the
//! continuation's first request writes a lock of its own. Its timeline
//! is `[that card, the notebook index, the host's opening message]` on a model
//! that reads its tools ahead of its system prompt
//! (`host_append::tools_precede_system`): the index is a system card, so it
//! reaches the model as the system prompt's very last section, right after the
//! conversation's own prompt (`aisdk::step::system_prompt_parts`), and the
//! tools and host sections before it stay the prefix this continuation shares
//! with any other conversation of the same setup. On any other model that end
//! comes before the tools, so the timeline is `[that card, the opening
//! message]` and the first run hands the index over at its first round
//! boundary instead, behind the opening message — as an instruction, by the
//! carrier the model has for one (`host_append::instruction_carrier`). Either
//! way the index is frozen once given: later writes to the notebook never move
//! what the continuation was told. The
//! opening message is the prompt profile's text, so what the continuation is
//! told to do first is the user's to reword. A conversation with notes is offered
//! `read_handoff_note` from its first request on, and gains the other three once
//! it is armed itself; its notebook starts as the copy, so a chain of handoffs
//! keeps editing one set of notes rather than starting over.
//!
//! The continuation is titled `<origin title>-handover-<number>`. A
//! continuation's own handoff counts under the same origin, so a chain reads
//! `-handover-1`, `-handover-2`, … rather than stacking suffixes. It takes the
//! source's place in the conversation tree instead of hanging beneath it.
//!
//! The source is left exactly as it was. Its timeline ends on the `handoff`
//! card, which names the continuation.
