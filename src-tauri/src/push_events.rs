//! Backend-initiated push events.
//!
//! Every other renderer/backend exchange in Mewrk is renderer-initiated
//! (invoke + per-call streaming channels). This hub is the one seam through
//! which the backend may speak first: the renderer subscribes once at startup
//! with a long-lived channel, and backend subsystems publish through the hub
//! whenever something happens that must not wait for the next renderer call —
//! the first consumer is background document-write failure.
//!
//! Delivery rules:
//! - At most one live subscriber (the main renderer document). A new
//!   subscription replaces the previous channel — after a browser-dev
//!   reconnect the old channel writes into a closed socket, so latest wins.
//! - Events published while no subscriber is reachable are buffered in a
//!   bounded backlog (oldest dropped) and flushed to the next subscriber, so
//!   a failure during startup or between reconnects is reported late rather
//!   than never.
