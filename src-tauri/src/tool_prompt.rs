//! In-app approval prompts for model tool calls.
//!
//! The native `MessageDialog` this replaces was modal to the whole OS and
//! carried no state beyond the single answer. Approval is now a card above the
//! composer, driven by two shapes of prompt that share one registry:
//!
//! * **Model prompts.** A worker thread blocks on a one-shot channel while the
//!   card travels to the renderer, which answers through `resolve_tool_prompt`
//!   and wakes the worker. The waiter may be the top-level run's own thread or
//!   a detached task worker; [`PromptOwner`] is what tells them apart.
//! * **Manual prompts.** The tool editor's own calls have no run to stream
//!   through, so `request_tool_approval` returns the prompt descriptor instead
//!   of blocking, and the nonce is minted only when the answer arrives. The
//!   classified request stays host-side across those two calls, so the renderer
//!   cannot widen between asking and answering.
//!
//! # A card is not owned by a turn
//!
//! Tasks outlive the turn that created them (S11), so a workflow step or a
//! subagent can request approval after the top-level round ends. Cards travel
//! the app push channel when no run stream is open, and the renderer draws them
//! exactly as it draws cards from a run stream.
//!
//! A run end retracts only the cards that the run itself raised
//! ([`ToolPromptRegistry::cancel_run_prompts`]); a task's card survives the turn
//! exactly as the task does.
//!
//! `Ok(false)` means the user said no. Every other ending — stopped, timed out,
//! or no channel to ask through — is an `Err` that identifies the actual
//! outcome, so an unseen question is never attributed to the user as a refusal.
//!
//! Two invariants keep the "always allow" affordance from becoming a hole:
//!
//! * It is offered per (conversation, tool name) only, so allowing `read`
//!   never allows `write`, and it never crosses into another conversation —
//!   not even one branched, forked or continued from it. It is saved with the
//!   conversation, so it outlives a restart and dies with the conversation.
//! * A decision the security classifier marked `mandatory_prompt` — VM guest
//!   authorization, global memory mutation, an MCP server that declares it
//!   needs interaction — can neither offer nor consume an allowance. Those
//!   cross a boundary the conversation's security level does not describe, so
//!   every one of them asks again.
