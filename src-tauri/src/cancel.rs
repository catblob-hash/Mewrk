//! Cancellation signal for one synchronous execution.
//!
//! Stopping has two independent sources, while a blocking synchronous leg such as a
//! `bash`/`powershell` child process or hook command observes only the flag it polls:
//!
//! * **Run-level:** the user stops the whole model run
//!   ([`crate::state::AppState::cancel_model_run`]).
//! * **Task-level:** the user stops one sidebar task, a workflow skips a step, or a
//!   `Promise.race` cancels its losers.
//!
//! A task can survive across turns, so stopping a task and stopping its parent run
//! remain separate operations. `CancelSignal` combines the sources supplied at its
//! construction point; a poll site asks only [`CancelSignal::cancelled`] and need not
//! distinguish task from run.
//!
//! Construction follows ownership: task turns receive their task flag and top-level
//! turns receive their run flag. Sources must not be dynamically combined from a
//! conversation's current run, because that could stop an unrelated foreground run
//! and kill a surviving background task's synchronous leg.
//!
//! An empty signal ([`CancelSignal::default`]) has no sources and never cancels. It is
//! used by IPC-driven tool execution and direct test paths, not to indicate cancellation.
