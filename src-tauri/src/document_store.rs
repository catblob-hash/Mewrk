//! In-memory authoritative snapshot of the persisted document plus a
//! background writer.
//!
//! Every IPC command used to re-read and re-validate the whole document from
//! disk (O(document) JSON parse + shape walk under the global storage lock,
//! measured in seconds on real data). The store keeps one validated
//! `Arc<AppDocument>` in memory: reads are an `Arc` clone, commits swap the
//! snapshot synchronously and persist asynchronously with latest-wins
//! coalescing. The disk file remains the crash-recovery source of truth; the
//! writer fsyncs exactly like the old synchronous path did.
//!
//! Consistency rules:
//! - Commands keep serializing document read→validate→commit sections with
//!   `AppState::storage_lock` exactly as before; this module adds no new
//!   cross-command ordering assumptions.
//! - While no commit is pending, an external change to the file on disk
//!   (for example, a manual recovery edit) is detected via (mtime, len) and
//!   triggers a reload, matching the old always-read-from-disk behaviour.
//!   Current Mewrk builds deliberately hold one exclusive app-data lease,
//!   so two live processes cannot race document and attachment state.
//! - A failed background write is reported by the next `commit` (and retried
//!   with each later commit and on `flush`), so the renderer still surfaces
//!   "save failure" without blocking the interactive path. In addition, the
//!   optional write-failure observer (`set_write_failure_observer`) is
//!   invoked the moment the background writer fails — once per distinct
//!   failure, not per retry — and again with `None` when a later attempt
//!   succeeds, so the renderer can be told immediately over the push-event
//!   channel instead of waiting for its next save.
