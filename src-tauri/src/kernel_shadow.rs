//! The shadow kernel feeds protocol events observed on the main turn thread to
//! `agent_kernel::Kernel`, the implementation projection of the `formal/`
//! specifications. Observation never changes host control flow. Divergences are
//! logged and become panics when `MEWRK_KERNEL_SHADOW=strict`. Every divergence
//! is triaged as an implementation defect first; the formal model changes only
//! when a deliberate safety decision demands it.
//!
//! Main-thread observation satisfies environment assumption A2. Approval callbacks
//! can arrive on worker threads, so state is protected by a `Mutex`; a poisoned lock
//! disables observation rather than failing the host.
//!
//! ## Projection limits and invariants
//!
//! * Slots are reusable containers. Calls map by call ID and tasks by agent name;
//!   settled entries release their slots. Entities outside the finite shadow scope
//!   increment `scope_gaps` and are ignored.
//! * The danger bit means approval is known to be required before dispatch. Wrapped
//!   executor callbacks observe its outcome, then emit `Approve -> ExecStart ->
//!   ExecEnd` in causal order. A successful dangerous call with no observed approval
//!   emits `ExecStart` and is rejected by S1.
//! * Synchronous calls carry no identity. The host keeps one `ToolCall` from request
//!   through settlement, and the shadow audits A3 by comparing parameter digests at
//!   `tool_request` and `tool_finished`.
//! * Task identities are host-generated `TaskIdentity` values. The shadow binds each
//!   tracked identity to a finite rid: the tracked identity uses its rid, a newer
//!   same-name incarnation is a scope gap, and stale or mismatched identities use a
//!   non-current rid so the kernel rejects them. This requires monotonic generations
//!   and host guards that discard stale worker writes.
//! * `run_task_wait` starts `TaskWait` at the blocking-window boundary, completes it
//!   with settlement and `TaskWaitDeliver`, and withdraws it with `TaskWaitTimeout`
//!   when no delivery occurs. `TurnCancel` voids all pending waits.
//! * Aborted turns emit `TurnCancel`, settle stranded calls by phase, and close the
//!   active round before teardown. `TurnEnd` retains running tasks in idle so they
//!   survive across turns.
//! * Undelivered terminal envelopes are observed before TurnStart without claiming
//!   them, satisfying S11's requirement to fold them before the first RoundStart.
//!   Completions observed later are emitted when fold or wait consumes their envelope.
//!   Every terminal envelope is projected as `Complete`, whatever ended the task.
//! * Round boundaries close active rounds. Host injections are projected as queued
//!   steer events immediately before the next `RoundStart`.
//! * Folded tasks emit `AgentFold` (preceded by `AgentComplete` if not yet observed)
//!   and create delivery work for a later round — a task the user closed included.
//!   Folding during abort is a divergence.
//! * Workflow drivers and background shell commands use the outer task pool and the
//!   same spawn, wait, fold, and settlement projection as agents. Their internal
//!   workers remain outside this scope. `web_search` and `web_fetch` use the call
//!   pipeline as asynchronous tools.
//! * `PolicyTighten` and `ContextEdit` have no host emission point and are covered by
//!   crate consistency tests and CSP scenarios.
