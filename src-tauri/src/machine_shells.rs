//! Which shell backends each machine has, found by probing it.
//!
//! A machine's shells are machine state, like its WSL distributions: they
//! change when someone installs or removes one, so they are asked of the
//! machine rather than configured. What the renderer and the model are told is
//! the last answer, kept here and in `machine-shells.json` beside the document
//! so a conversation opened before the machine has been reached this session
//! still lists the right tools.
//!
//! A probe only looks for the backends the combination table registers on the
//! machine's OS ([`crate::shell_backend::backends_for`]); the rest are never
//! asked about. When a machine is probed:
//!
//! - **This machine**: at startup, and again from its settings.
//! - **An SSH machine**: the first time this process connects to it (the link
//!   hub calls back on the first connection, or on falling back to per-command
//!   SSH), and from its settings — including right after it is added, which is
//!   when the renderer records its agent shell.
//! - **A WSL distribution**: the first time this process runs something for a
//!   workspace on it, and from its settings.
//!
//! Entries are keyed by [`crate::run_environment::env_key`]: `local`,
//! `wsl:<distro>`, `ssh:<machine id>`. An SSH machine keeps its id when its
//! address is edited, so its answer also records the [`Endpoint`] it was
//! taken from, and is used only while the machine still has that endpoint.
//! Otherwise a probe of the new address that fails (the machine is offline,
//! or the app restarts) would leave the old machine's OS and shell paths in
//! force for the new one.
