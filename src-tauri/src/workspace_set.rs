//! The numbered workspaces a conversation can reach, resolved by the host.
//!
//! A conversation works in one or more directories, and each of them lives on a
//! machine: the host, a WSL distribution, or a registered SSH machine. This
//! module turns the persisted record of that — the project's workspace 1, the
//! project's further workspaces, then the conversation's own attached ones —
//! into the single list everything else reads.
//!
//! The list is ordered and 1-based, and that number is the whole of the model's
//! addressing scheme. It is what the `workspace` parameter on every path-taking
//! tool carries, what the `# Environment` section enumerates, and what decides
//! which shell a command can run in. Paths are never how the model selects a
//! machine: a path is resolved *inside* the workspace it named, so naming a
//! directory can never reach a machine the conversation was not granted.
//!
//! Resolution is host-only, like [`ShellRunner`] itself. It reads the persisted
//! conversation and the machine catalog; neither renderer input nor a tool
//! argument can introduce a root or a machine that is not already recorded.
