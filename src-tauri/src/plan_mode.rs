//! Plan mode: a switch under the composer that asks the model to research,
//! write a plan and get it approved before it changes anything.
//!
//! Independent of the security level: the level decides what the model's calls
//! need whether or not a plan is being written. What the switch does:
//!
//! - **Guidance, appended.** Each time the switch goes on, the round boundary
//!   appends the plan-mode system prompt (`system.plan_mode`) at that point of
//!   the transcript (`system_append.rs`) — never into the system prompt itself,
//!   which would cost the whole prompt cache. Turned off by hand before a plan
//!   was approved, it appends `system.plan_mode_exit`; an approved plan needs
//!   no such note, its tool result says so.
//! - **Tools, once.** The first time, `plan` and `exit_plan_mode` join the tool
//!   set (`tool_append.rs`), and they stay: switching plan mode on again never
//!   appends them a second time.
//! - **Exit.** Approving a plan turns the switch off — the live cell at once,
//!   so the turn that asked can go on to implement it, and the persisted
//!   setting, which the renderer mirrors.
//! - **The repository is left alone.** `write` and `edit` refuse a target Git
//!   would count as a change — tracked, or inside a work tree and not ignored,
//!   a new file included (`git_core::write_changes_repository` here, the
//!   repository probe in `remote_files.rs` on another machine) — with
//!   `repository_write_refusal`. The run loop checks before the call meets a
//!   permission hook or an approval card (`tool_executor::plan_mode_refusal`),
//!   so the user is never asked about a write that would be refused. Nothing
//!   else is checked: shell commands are the guidance's to rule, and paths
//!   outside a repository or ignored by Git stay writable.
//! - **One way out.** Only `exit_plan_mode` puts the plan to the user. A turn
//!   that simply ends, ends: nothing reminds the model and nothing is put to
//!   the user on its behalf.
