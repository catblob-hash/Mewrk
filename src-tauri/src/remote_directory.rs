//! Reading a directory on a machine that is not this one.
//!
//! The host has a native folder dialog only for its own filesystem, so a
//! workspace on a WSL distribution or an SSH machine is chosen by browsing it
//! here: one level per call, read through that machine's own shell.
//!
//! The picker is where a machine is first met, so it assumes as little about
//! it as it can. An SSH login shell may be any Unix shell, or `cmd.exe` or
//! PowerShell on Windows, and bash may not be installed at all. It reads a
//! Unix machine with `/bin/sh` alone and a Windows machine with the
//! PowerShell every Windows ships. Which of the two a machine is comes from
//! its agent when the agent serves it ([`crate::remote_link`]) — a Windows
//! machine is then read as Windows whichever shell it logs in with — and
//! otherwise from its login shell ([`remote_shell::login_shell`]).
//!
//! This is picker code, not tool code. It never runs anything the model asked
//! for: the scripts are fixed, the only variable in them is the directory the
//! user is looking at, and that goes through the quoting of the language it is
//! spliced into.
