//! The `workflow` tool runs a declarative plan as a pooled task with concurrent subagents.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The driver is one task in the outer [`AgentPool`] and returns a derived acknowledgement
//! immediately; no limit refuses or delays it. `complete_turn` envelopes plan results for
//! delivery through `task_wait` or a round-boundary fold. The driver owns a nested private pool
//! with `with_live_limit(min(16, max(2, parallelism - 2)))`; step subagents use that pool and do
//! not take turns with the session's `agent_spawn` subagents or share their namespace. Step templates derive
//! from the original depth-0 request, so every step has depth 1. Driver templates never run a
//! model.
//!
//! Step names are allocated only from the private live pool. Stable slot names make ordinary-step
//! execution-mode payloads byte-stable across runs. Role steps use a separate `ws<N>-as-<role>`
//! namespace so role and ordinary steps do not share a reservation key. A step-level `model` is
//! rejected: roles are the complete model-facing input and user configuration selects their model.
//!
//! # Isolated worktrees
//!
//! A step with `isolation: "worktree"` receives its own worktree of the conversation's workspace 1
//! at `<workspace>/.mewrk/worktrees/<runId>/ws<N>` on `mewrk/wf/<runId>/ws<N>`, on whichever
//! machine that workspace is: Git runs there, through the machine's agent for WSL and SSH (see
//! [`StepRepository`]). The worktree stands in for workspace 1 in the step's workspace set, so it
//! is where the step's file tools, shells and safety classifier act, and the directory it came
//! from is no longer one of the step's roots. It checks out `HEAD`, excluding uncommitted parent
//! changes. Cleanup runs after `await_quiescence`, on the same machine: only unchanged worktrees
//! with no additional commits are removed. Isolation is excluded from execution-mode payloads, so
//! it does not require a separate namespace.
//!
//! # Deadline and cancellation
//!
//! Each run has one [`WORKFLOW_RUN_DEADLINE`] budget, kept by a [`RunClock`] that starts when the
//! driver starts — after the run's own approval card has been answered — and stands still while a
//! step waits on an approval card. Progress updates may wake the wait but never extend it; only a
//! person's time on a card does. Round settlement cancels the outer pool; the
//! shared cancellation flag makes heartbeats and event forwarding fail immediately, ending the
//! driver as Interrupted within one `WAIT_POLL_INTERVAL`. Interrupted results retain step logs for
//! resume and are delivered like any other terminal result; when the user closed the run, the body
//! says so.
//!
//! # Records
//!
//! Worker completion writes synthesized `workflow_step` contexts and plan results through
//! `complete_turn`; `finalize_agent_pool` copies accumulated records into the `workflow` context.
//! Records use `WorkflowStep` and the pool name, but kind-based rejection prevents finished
//! workflows from being continued. A run is recovered by `resume_run_id`, or, when the last exit
//! interrupted it, by the host itself at the conversation's next round boundary
//! ([`resume_interrupted_run`]).
