//! Conversation-scoped background subagent runtime backing the `agent` tool
//! group: `agent_spawn`, `task_wait`, and `task_list`.
//!
//! Only the user can stop a task, through `stop_conversation_task` over IPC;
//! the model has no entry point for stopping another task. `request_stop` is
//! called only by user IPC and targeted host paths such as workflow step cancellation.
//!
//! The host never terminates a task for inactivity. A terminal state may result
//! only from an explicit user stop, a worker return, or cancellation-timeout escalation.
//!
//! Top-level tasks are held by `AppState` per conversation and run in detached
//! threads, so round settlement does not interrupt them. Idle completion can
//! trigger a wake notification. Nested agents (`depth > 0`) retain a private
//! round pool and end at child-round quiescence. Agent identity is
//! durable: the child transcript is persisted on its spawn tool context, and a
//! later turn rehydrates it from the conversation timeline so `task_wait` can
//! still address the agent.
//!
//! Communication model: a child is one-shot. The parent hands it its whole
//! task at spawn and never speaks to it again — the parent cannot see inside a
//! child, so a mid-run instruction or a second task could only be written
//! blind. The only channel runs the other way:
//! - child → parent: `subagent_update` progress envelopes plus an automatic
//!   final-result envelope, both drained by `task_wait`;
//! - worker → current or future run: the conversation-scoped task surface
//!   (`AppState::task_surface`) drops idle sinks and rejects idle approvals;
//!   see `api.rs` `agent_worker_loop`.
