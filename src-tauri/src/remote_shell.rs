//! Speaking through a remote login shell whose dialect is not known in advance.
//!
//! OpenSSH never runs a command directly. sshd hands the command string to the
//! account's login shell — `$SHELL -c` on a Unix machine, the registry's
//! `DefaultShell` on Windows — and that may be bash, zsh, dash, ksh, fish, tcsh,
//! nushell, `cmd.exe` or PowerShell. The host cannot choose it and should not
//! have to know it, so every remote leg gets past it as early as possible:
//!
//! - On a Unix-like machine the whole POSIX script travels inside one fixed
//!   line, [`posix_line`], whose payload every one of those shells reads as the
//!   same literal text. `/bin/sh` is the only program it assumes.
//! - On a Windows machine whose login shell is `cmd.exe` or PowerShell, the
//!   script is PowerShell sent as `-EncodedCommand` base64 ([`powershell_line`]):
//!   letters, digits and `+/=`, which no shell rewrites.
//!
//! Which of the two a machine needs is asked with [`PROBE_COMMAND`], a line
//! every shell can run, and remembered per endpoint for the life of the app.
