//! The seam between `.mewrk/launch.json` and the dev servers it describes.
//!
//! [`crate::preview_launch_config`] reads the file and [`crate::preview_servers`]
//! owns the processes; neither knows the other exists. This module is the only
//! place that does, so the order a start has to follow — resolve the entry, hand
//! back an attach entry before anything else looks at it, decide whether a running
//! server already answers it, reserve capacity, reserve the port, rewrite the port
//! arguments, spawn — stays in one readable function instead of being spread
//! across Tauri commands and a future tool handler.
//!
//! Two voices meet here. Anything that came out of the two ported modules is the
//! Claude Code desktop app's own English, passed through byte for byte because
//! those strings are the diagnosis; anything this layer decides for itself is in
//! the host's ordinary voice, like every other command error.
//!
//! One deliberate departure from that byte-for-byte rule: the config path reads
//! `.mewrk/launch.json`, not the source's `.claude/launch.json`. The source's
//! path belongs to a different product that may be installed alongside this one,
//! so sharing it would have the two fight over one file.
