//! Durable conversation storage in a process-local SQLite database. The host is the sole writer.
//!
//! Each message occupies one JSON-backed row, updated with row-scoped `UPSERT`s. `run_model`
//! persists every canonical context directly, without renderer round trips or debounce.
//! Streaming prose uses `streaming` status and becomes `settled` when finalized; startup recovery
//! marks stale streaming rows as `interrupted`.
//!
//! User-editable non-conversation configuration remains in the `document.v1.json` anchor file.
