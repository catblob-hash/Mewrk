//! The prompt profile: every host-authored, model-visible fixed text in one
//! registry.
//!
//! A *prompt profile* (the user-facing name is "tool-description file", the
//! format users hand-write under the global `~/.mewrk/tool-descriptions/*.json`;
//! a workspace's own folder is never read) declares two things: per-tool
//! description overrides (`tools`) and the wording of
//! every place where Mewrk itself injects fixed text into a model request
//! (`prompts`). There is one built-in profile, "Mewrk built-in": its English
//! texts are code in [`english`], so they ship with each build and change with
//! it. Nothing writes them to disk and nothing edits them in place. A user who
//! wants other wording writes a tool-description file; it overrides only the
//! keys it names, and every other key falls back to the built-in. The registry
//! below carries the key ids, their placeholders and their documentation; the
//! texts sit in [`english`], one match arm per key.
//!
//! What lives here, in one sentence per group: the capability sections appended
//! to the system prompt; the safety boundaries; the child agent addendum and
//! its internal tools; the wording of receipts the host writes back to the
//! model (task waits, task lists, background notifications, memory
//! acknowledgements, skill loads); the isolated web-search executor's prompts;
//! and the framing lines file/shell tools put around their output.
//!
//! A key may ship an *empty* default, which means the host says nothing at that
//! point unless a profile fills it in. The web-evidence texts are the ones that
//! do: a search backend is something the user configured themselves, so Mewrk
//! treats it as trusted and adds no untrusted-content boundary of its own. The
//! keys stay in the registry so a profile that does not trust its backend can
//! put the wording back.
//!
//! What deliberately does NOT live here: the conversation's own system prompt
//! (that is a per-conversation setting the user types in the UI, not a host
//! text), structural tokens the renderer or the host parses back (`[Image #N]`,
//! `[agent · status]` envelope brackets, `<task-notification>` element names,
//! `shell:<id>` addresses, JSON field names) and tool *error* messages. Errors
//! are English and fixed; they say what went wrong, they do not instruct the
//! model.
//!
//! Every key has a stable id, a declared placeholder set and a one-line
//! description; the golden export in `docs/context-injections/` is generated
//! from this registry and the documentation site is built from that export.
