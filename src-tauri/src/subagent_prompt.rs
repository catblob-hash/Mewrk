//! The host-authored addendum every child agent's system prompt carries.
//!
//! # Why V1 is frozen
//!
//! V1's exact bytes are inside every conversation fork's persisted
//! `system_prompt_snapshot`. That snapshot is signed by
//! `MemoryStore::sign_fork_system_prompt_receipt` and, through the frozen
//! `ForkModelBindingV1` projection, is also one of the fields inside
//! `canonical_subagent_execution_mode_payload`. Neither receipt has an update
//! path, so editing V1 would not merely invalidate stored forks: for the
//! execution-mode receipt it would permanently burn the
//! `(conversation_id, name)` pair it was reserved under. V1 therefore never
//! changes for any reason — a new shape lands as a new variant.
//!
//! `PromptVersion::V1` deliberately carries no language. V1 renders Chinese
//! unconditionally, and making its bytes a function of anything would silently
//! change frozen output. Because the variant has no fields, that is enforced by
//! the type rather than by a comment. V2 is the first shape whose text is
//! selected: it is `subagent.addendum` of the run's prompt profile
//! (`prompt_profile::PromptKey::SubagentAddendum`), so the built-in profile
//! and a user-authored file each render exactly one variant — never two at
//! once, which would double the tokens on every child turn and double the bytes
//! inside a signed fork snapshot.
//!
//! # The version selects only the addendum
//!
//! `render` never rewrites, summarises, truncates or inspects `base`. Every
//! version applies the same `str::trim` to the caller's prompt (Unicode
//! `White_Space`, so U+3000 and U+00A0 count) and the same
//! `\n\n---\n\n` section separator that `lib::append_system_prompt_section`
//! uses crate-wide. A `base` that already contains that separator, or that
//! quotes a memory delimiter literally, is passed through untouched: presence of
//! host-owned context is never inferred from arbitrary system-prompt text.
//!
//! # Deliberate product limitation
//!
//! `api::restore_conversation_fork_binding` overwrites the freshly rendered
//! template prompt with the persisted `system_prompt_snapshot`, which remains
//! authoritative for the rest of that fork's life. An existing conversation fork
//! therefore does not receive V2's instruction-source-boundary paragraph; the
//! product does not re-render or re-sign a fork on resume.
//!
//! Named and ordinary children are the opposite case:
//! `api::build_rehydrated_agent_template` re-renders them from the definition or
//! from the parent prompt on every resume, and the rendered text appears in
//! neither receipt payload (the definition receipt's `systemPrompt` is the raw
//! document prompt, and `AgentDefinitionBindingV1` has no prompt field at all),
//! so they pick a version bump up retroactively with no receipt impact.

PromptVersion::current no longer selects V2. That may be right, but it is not a prompt-only edit.\n\
api::agent_child_template renders this version into the child's system_prompt; for a conversation \
fork, api::inherit_parent_model_memory_for_fork snapshots it verbatim as system_prompt_snapshot and \
signs system_prompt_receipt over it, and BOTH are fields of the frozen model::ForkModelBindingV1 \
projection. So this value moves canonical_subagent_execution_mode_payload's bytes, and \
memory::MemoryStore::reserve_subagent_execution_mode_receipt has insert / identical-no-op / \
hard-error branches only — no UPDATE, no production DELETE. Each selected version therefore \
reserves forks under its exact bytes and differs from existing reservations under other bytes.\n\
Editing V2's own bytes has the same effect as changing the selected variant. Named and ordinary \
children are NOT affected — their prompt is in no receipt payload.\n\
api::run_agent_spawn reads memory::MemoryStore::reserved_subagent_execution_mode_names into its \
dedupe gate, so a name whose reservation row outlived its persisted record remains visible: auto_name \
skips it and an explicit request for it gets the ordinary rename advice. Do NOT read that as permission \
