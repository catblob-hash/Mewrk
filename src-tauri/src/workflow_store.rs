//! On-disk artifacts for workflow runs.
//!
//! Each run is stored in `<app_data_dir>/workflows/<conversationId>/<runId>/`:
//!
//! - `script.js`: the approved script body of the latest attempt. A scriptless resume checks its
//!   SHA-256 against the timeline; a resume with an edited, re-approved script replaces it.
//! - `args.json`: the `args` of the latest attempt, so a resume may omit them.
//! - `journal.jsonl`: append-only `started`, `result`, and diagnostic-only `settled` records.
//! - `manifest.json`: run summary. A `running` status after restart identifies an interrupted run.
//! - `steps/<index>.json`: complete records for individual steps; `steps/<index>.key` names the
//!   step that wrote each one.
//!
//! # Why artifacts stay on disk
//!
//! Run artifacts can exhaust the 16 MiB document limit and do not need document synchronization or
//! versioning. Timeline records retain only compact fingerprints and summaries.
//!
//! # Why journal failures are non-fatal
//!
//! The journal enables recovery, not execution. Failed writes make a run non-resumable but must not
//! fail working steps. Writes only warn; malformed read records are skipped so a partial JSON line
//! cannot invalidate earlier results.
//!
//! # Unconditional journaling
//!
//! Every run writes a journal. Recovery is a property of runs, not an optional setting.
