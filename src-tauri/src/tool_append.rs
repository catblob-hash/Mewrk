//! Tools that join a conversation after its first request.
//!
//! Every request declares a tool list, and every protocol puts that list at
//! the head of the prompt, ahead of the system prompt and the history. A tool
//! that joins mid-conversation — the user ticks it in the settings, the run
//! arms the handoff tools, `tool_search` hands out an MCP schema — used to be
//! written into that list, which rewrote the head of the prompt and threw the
//! whole prompt cache away. Here it is appended instead: the transcript records
//! the point it joined at, and each protocol that has a tool-append interface
//! hands the tool over there, at the end of the transcript as it stood.
//!
//! - Anthropic Messages: a mid-conversation `role: "system"` message carrying
//!   `tool_addition` blocks, the tool itself declared with `defer_loading`.
//! - OpenAI Responses (and Azure, and the Codex backend): an `additional_tools`
//!   input item with the tool's definition.
//! - Every other protocol has no such interface; the sidecar folds the tool
//!   back into the declared list, which is what happened before.
//!
//! Whether a model takes the interface at its endpoint is a capability the
//! model declares, as it declares vision: Mewrk fills it in where it knows
//! ([`known`]), the user where it does not — a relay that may or may not pass
//! the interface on. The sidecar appends only where it is declared.
//!
//! The host's part is protocol-neutral: decide which tools are new, record the
//! point, and project it as one marker message. The sidecar turns the marker
//! into the protocol's own shape (`aisdk-service/src/tool-append.ts`). No text
//! goes with it — the tool simply becomes available.
