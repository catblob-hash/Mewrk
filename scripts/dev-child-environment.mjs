// What a development launcher is allowed to hand down to the application it starts.
//
// `npm run dev:browser` and `npm run tauri:dev` both start from this process's own
// environment, which npm has already shaped for its own output and which
// `windowsNativeBuildEnvironment()` then reshapes for the MSYS2 toolchain. Two of
// those values are wrong for the application:
//
//   * `FORCE_COLOR` makes every plain Node command the app runs emit ANSI escapes,
//     which land verbatim in the terminal surface and in anything that reads a
//     command's output as text. It also suppresses the host's own `NO_COLOR=1`
//     default, because that default only applies when neither colour variable is
//     already present.
//
//   * The build `PATH` puts `<msys2>\mingw64\bin` and `<msys2>\usr\bin` *ahead* of
//     `System32`, which is what makes `gcc` resolve to the native compiler. The
//     application inherits that order and passes it to every shell it opens, where
//     a bare `cmd` then resolves to `<msys2>\usr\bin\cmd` — a bash script — instead
//     of `System32\cmd.exe`. `usr\bin` shadows `find`, `sort`, `more`, `link` and
//     `tar` the same way.
//
// The build environment still needs the toolchain first, so the launcher cannot
// simply stop prepending. Instead it carries the *application* PATH alongside the
// build PATH in a handoff variable, and the Rust entry point restores it before it
// creates any thread or child process (`child_environment.rs`). The toolchain
// directories are appended rather than dropped, so a GNU-target binary can still
// find its runtime DLLs while `System32` wins every name lookup.
//
// A user who configures `FORCE_COLOR` or `PATH` on one command inside the app is
// unaffected: this only reshapes what the launcher itself inherited.
