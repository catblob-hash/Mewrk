/**
 * Opt-in stable code signature for macOS development runs.
 *
 * Every `cargo build` links a new ad-hoc signature into the application binary, and macOS
 * binds Keychain "Always Allow" answers and privacy grants (Desktop, Documents, Local Network,
 * ...) to the signature that received them, so after each rebuild Mewrk is asked about them
 * again. When `MEWRK_DEV_SIGNING_IDENTITY` names a code-signing identity — an "Apple
 * Development" certificate from Xcode, or a self-signed code-signing certificate made in
 * Keychain Access — Cargo runs the binary through scripts/macos-dev-run.sh, which re-signs it
 * with that identity under the fixed identifier `com.mewrk.app` first.
 *
 * Cargo reads a runner from `CARGO_TARGET_<TRIPLE>_RUNNER`; both Mac triples are set because a
 * host build looks up the host's. A runner the developer configured is never replaced, and
 * nothing changes on other hosts or without the variable.
