// Supervision of the `cargo test` child, kept apart from `cargo-test.mjs` so the wrapper's
// lifecycle can be tested with injected adapters instead of a real crate build.
//
// What this is for: `npm run test:rust` used to spawn cargo and do nothing but forward its exit
// code. A Ctrl+C therefore ended the wrapper while cargo and the `mewrk_lib-<hash>.exe` harness
// it started kept running, and a leftover harness holds its own image open — the next link then
// fails with LNK1104 and waiting does not help, because nothing is going to release it.
//
// Two rules follow from that, and both are pinned by scripts/tests/cargo-test-lifecycle.test.mjs:
//
//   * Ownership is by process id. The wrapper ends the tree rooted at the process *it* started
//     and nothing else. Killing by image name would reach `mewrk_lib` binaries belonging to
//     another session, another worktree, or the developer's own debugger.
//   * A run that did not finish on its own terms reports a non-zero exit code, and only the
//     child's `close` event counts as finished. Text on the terminal — including a `test result:
//     ok` summary — says nothing about whether the process is still alive.
