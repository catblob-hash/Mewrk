// The app uploads its build to an SSH machine whenever the machine is not
// running exactly that build (src-tauri/src/remote_link.rs): updating a
// machine, or rolling it back, is only ever this app handing over its own
// agent, and the machine needs no network of its own for it.
//
// The installer carries only the agent of the platform it is built for: this
// computer's sandboxed commands run through it. `--bundle` (what `tauri build`
// runs as `beforeBuildCommand`) builds just that one — this machine's own
// triple, or the `--target` of a cross-built installer, which `tauri build`
// passes on in TAURI_ENV_TARGET_TRIPLE — and stages exactly it into
// `src-tauri/bundled-agents/<target-triple>/mewrk-remote[.exe]` (with
// `srt-win.exe` beside a Windows agent), clearing whatever else was there.
// `tauri.conf.json` ships that directory as the app's `remote-agents/`
// resources. It fails (exit status 1) if that build cannot be made: an
// installer without its own agent has no sandbox.
//
// Every other platform's agent (an SSH machine, WSL's Linux agent, an
// emulated Windows on Arm, ...) is not in the installer. The app fetches it
// from Mewrk's component channel the first time such a machine needs it, and
// so updates it with the app. What is on the channel is published from a full
// run — `--release` — by `npm run publish:components -- --remote-agents`,
// which reads `src-tauri/remote-agents/<target-triple>/`, where every run
// except `--bundle` stages its builds.
//
// Every build carries the digest of the agent source it was made from
// (`mewrk-remote-source:<sha256>`, see src-tauri/remote-agent/build.rs), and
// the app installs only builds made from its own source. A full run therefore
// removes staged builds this run could not remake and that were made from
// other source: published, they would only sit under a source id they do not
// have. `--release` then insists that every target has a build, because a
// release is the only place its machines can get one from; set
// MEWRK_REMOTE_AGENTS_ALLOW_MISSING=1 to publish without the missing ones
// anyway. A development build of the app that meets a machine with no build
// runs this script with `--only` for that machine's targets; exit status 3
// means this computer has no way to build the target asked for.
//
// This machine's own triple always builds. The others build when their Rust
// target is installed (`rustup target add <triple>`):
//
// * Linux musl targets link with the `rust-lld` rustup ships, so a Mac or
//   Windows machine needs no C cross toolchain for them: the agent has no C
//   dependencies and musl brings its own C runtime objects.
// * Apple targets build on a Mac (both architectures, with Xcode's SDK).
// * Windows targets build on Windows with Visual Studio's build tools, and
//   elsewhere with `cargo xwin` (https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-xwin),
//   which fetches Microsoft's CRT and SDK libraries on first use — under their
//   license, which whoever installs it accepts. A build made on another
//   machine can be staged by copying it to
//   `src-tauri/remote-agents/<target-triple>/mewrk-remote.exe`.
//
// Windows builds link the C runtime statically: the agent is uploaded to
// machines that need not have the Visual C++ runtime installed.
//
// A Windows build is staged with `srt-win.exe` beside it: the Windows backend
// of the sandbox (vendored, Apache-2.0, under `src-tauri/vendor/srt-win`),
// which the agent finds next to its own executable. It is a crate of its own,
// built here with the agent. Its SQLite is C, which `cargo xwin` archives with
// `llvm-lib`; when that is not on `PATH`, the `llvm-ar` of rustup's
// `llvm-tools` component stands in for it (`rustup component add llvm-tools`).
