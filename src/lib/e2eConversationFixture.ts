// Shared conversation construction for the browser E2E runners.
//
// Both runners used to start from `documentValue.workspaces.flatMap(w => w.conversations).at(0)`
// and clone whatever they found. The product seed has no conversations at all — the temporary
// workspace `createSeedDocument` ships carries `conversations: []`, and the Rust
// `product_default_document` does the same — so that read has nothing to return and each runner
// aborts during initialization, before it reaches a single mock request. Cloning a found
// conversation was also silently inheriting whatever settings it carried, which is the opposite
// of what a deterministic harness wants.
//
// This module builds a conversation from an explicit, complete `ConversationSettings` instead.
// It touches no DOM and reads no document, so both the runners and Vitest execute the very same
// construction path. Product behaviour is untouched: a fresh install still opens with no
// conversation.

/**
 * Every field of `ConversationSettings`, spelled out.
 *
 * The two defaults that differ from the product's own are deliberate and belong to the harness:
 * `securityLevel: "full_access"` because no human is present to answer an approval prompt, and
 * `reasoningEffort: "low"` because the more a model thinks, the less deterministic the transcript
 * (there is no level without thinking).
 * Everything else starts from the most restrictive value, so a runner that needs a tool, a
 * memory tier or a skill has to name it.
