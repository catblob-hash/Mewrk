/**
 * Reading model for the conversation's history.
 *
 * The host keeps one ordered record of everything that happened to a
 * conversation: every payload it put on the wire, every response, every hook
 * decision, every call as it actually ran and what it returned, and every change
 * to the timeline — what the user sent, what a run settled onto it, and what the
 * user edited by hand. This module turns those entries into what the history pane
 * draws: one bar per thing that happened at the top level — a turn the user
 * started, a run of context edits, a turn that was cut off — and inside each, the
 * messages it added, removed or rewrote.
 *
 * Nothing here re-derives what happened. Every label, preview and diff is
 * computed from the recorded bytes, so a pane built on it cannot drift from the
 * record it is describing. The two counters a turn shows are the exception that
 * proves it: the host counts them against the predecessor's own parts when each
 * request is written, because the renderer would have to read every payload back
 * to reach the same number.
