/**
 * The workflow progress card's projection: a flat row stream folded into a
 * phase → step tree.
 *
 * # Why the frontend re-does the host's merge
 *
 * The host keeps its own ledger (`workflow-core/src/progress.rs`) and emits one
 * entry per transition. The renderer cannot simply replay the host's final
 * ledger because it never receives one — it receives the transitions, possibly
 * missing a prefix (a page reload mid-run) and possibly out of order across a
 * reconnect. So the merge rule has to be idempotent and order-insensitive on
 * this side too, which is what upserting by identity buys.
 *
 * # Row identity
 *
 * `${kind}:${index}` — the same key the host merges on. A step upserts in place
 * for its whole lifetime, so the row a user is watching never jumps when it
 * finishes. Logs carry a host-assigned monotonic index and therefore never
 * collide; they accumulate rather than merge.
