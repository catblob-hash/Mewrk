/**
 * The streaming reveal: the text each commit adds sweeps in from left to right,

 * place ten times a second.
 *
 * "What this commit added" is decided on the text as rendered, not on the
 * source. A Markdown source and its rendering are not the same string (`**bo`
 * renders as `**bo` until the closing `**` turns it into bold `bo`), and the
 * text that changed is what has to move — so the split is the longest prefix
 * this render shares with the one already on screen.
 *
 * The new text is wrapped in `.stream-fresh` spans, whose mask the stylesheet
 * animates. Wrapping text rather than masking the whole block is what keeps the
 * sweep on the new words: a block-wide mask runs across the right-hand side of
 * every line at once, settled text included.
