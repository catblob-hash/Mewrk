 * reads those providers as unconfigured: the composer bounced an OpenAI Codex
 * (OAuth) provider to the settings page and silently dropped the message.
 *
 * `ProviderSettings/ProviderOptionsDrawer.tsx` is deliberately outside this

 * whether a stored endpoint should be rewritten — not a readiness gate.
