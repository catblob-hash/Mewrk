/**
 * The single entry point for a click on a file path the app detected.
 *
 * Paths are detected in model replies by `./remarkPathLinks`, which renders
 * them as `<button data-mewrk-path>`. Those buttons are generated at runtime
 * in unbounded numbers inside a component memoized to avoid re-parsing during
 * streaming, so activation is handled by one document-level capture listener
 * rather than a handler per node — the same reasoning as `./externalLinks`.
 *
 * A click is offered to the app first, through the handler registered by
 * `setPathOpenHandler`, so a file in the open workspace is shown in the file
 * pane. Only what the pane cannot reach is revealed in the system file manager,
 * which is the fallback this module started as.
 *
 * A `<button>` rather than an anchor keeps the two interceptors independent:
 * the external-link one inspects only `HTMLAnchorElement`, so it never sees
 * these nodes and listener order does not matter.
