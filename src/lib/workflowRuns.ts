/**
 * The one projection both workflow surfaces draw from: the compact card in the
 * message stream and the detail panel in the task container.
 *
 * # Why two sources are merged
 *
 * Neither source alone can describe a run.
 *
 * The **agent roster** is the only place a step's role, model, token total and
 * wall time exist, and the only source that survives the model run: a settled
 * workflow still has its steps because the host persisted each one's record.
 * What it cannot show is a slot that never got an agent — a step replayed from
 * the resume journal registers nothing (`workflow.rs` skips `pool.register` on
 * a cache hit), and neither does one still waiting on a concurrency slot.
 *
 * The **live progress ledger** has a row for every slot including those, plus
 * the run's narration lines, but it is fed by stream events that die with the
 * model run and it carries no per-step model or usage at all.
 *
 * So: the roster decides the table, the ledger fills in the slots the roster
 * cannot have, and a settled run simply has no ledger to merge.
 *
 * # Matching a step to its ledger row
 *
 * There is no plan index on a step for most of its life. The synthetic call id
 * carries one (`<parent call>-ws<N>`), but what survives into the roster is the
 * *context* id, which the host derives by hashing — the suffix is not
 * recoverable from it. `stepIndex` reaches the renderer only once a step's body
 * has been moved out to the run directory.
 *
 * So the match is the slot the host stated — `stepIndex` on an externalized
 * body, or the index in the step's run-scoped address (`<runId>/ws<N>`, on its
 * shell from the first streamed frame) — and otherwise the label, which both
 * sides render from the same `step_display_label`. Labels are
 * not unique by construction — an unlabelled step falls back to its phase name,
 * so two of them in one phase collide — which is why claiming is greedy: the
 * first unclaimed row with that label wins, and the second step takes the next.
 *
 * A step that matches nothing keeps a null plan index rather than being assigned
 * one by position. Position is the tempting fallback and the wrong one: it would
 * quietly hand a step the slot number of an unrelated row, and that number is
 * what Skip sends to the host.
