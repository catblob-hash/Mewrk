 * The warning is said once per conversation: after the first answer, the user
 * knows what an orange row means there. Which conversations have heard it is
 * kept for this session of the app only — the cache it is about does not
 * outlive the session by much either. "Don't show again" is a view preference
 * of the same class as a catalog's row order, and lives in `localStorage`
 * beside those.
