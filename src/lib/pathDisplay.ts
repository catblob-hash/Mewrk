/**
 * How a path is shortened when it is drawn somewhere too narrow for it.
 *
 * A path is read from both ends — the start says where it lives, the end says what it is — so it
 * gives way in the middle, a whole directory at a time, and keeps its first and last names:
 *
 *     /Users/me/Desktop/projects/mewrk  →  /Users/…/projects/mewrk  →  /Users/…/mewrk
 *
 * Names come back from the tail end first, since the directories nearest the last name say the
 * most about it. When even `first/…/last` does not fit, those two names are shortened in their own
 * middles — the first one before the last, which is the name the path is about:
 *
 *     /Users/…/mewrk  →  /U…s/…/mewrk  →  /U…/…/me…rk
 *
 * Every separator is shown as written, `\` or `/`, and a root, a drive or a UNC prefix stays with
 * the first name.
