//! System prompts the host appended mid-conversation, handed to each protocol
//! as its own mid-conversation system message.
//!
//! The host records the point an instruction starts to apply — plan mode
//! switched on or off again, the request to hand off, a continuation's notes —
//! as one message: a `system` message whose
//! `providerOptions.mewrk.systemAppend` is `true` (Rust
//! `system_append::marker_message`). It never reaches a provider as that.
//! Here it becomes:
//!
//! - Anthropic Messages, on a model the host says takes it at this endpoint
//!   (`request.systemAppend`): a mid-conversation `role: "system"` message,
//!   where Anthropic's placement rule allows one — right after a user turn (a
//!   tool result is one), before an assistant turn or at the end. Consecutive
//!   system messages count as one section, so a tool addition beside it does
//!   not break the rule.
//! - OpenAI Responses, Azure and the Codex backend: a `system` / `developer`
//!   input item in place.
//! - The Chat protocols (OpenAI's, compatible endpoints, xAI), where the host
//!   says the model takes one: a `system` message in place.
//! - Everything else, and a marker that breaks a placement rule: its text is
//!   lifted into the tail of the system prompt — correct, and uncached from
//!   there on. A model that does not take one gets the instruction as a
//!   `<system-reminder>` user message instead (Rust `system_append::carry`),
//!   so this is left to a placement rule that refuses it.
//!
//! The sidecar does not second-guess the endpoint: `systemAppend` is the
//! model's declared capability, which the user declares for a relay that
//! keeps the message and Mewrk only where it knows.
//!
//! The Anthropic dialect keeps one more fallback for an endpoint that refuses
//! the message anyway (`anthropic-dialect.ts`, `liftSystemMessages`).
