//! Native, provider-executed `web_search` tool.
//!
//! Select factories by wire-protocol family rather than vendor or model ID. The native search
//! backend can only be the conversation's model provider, not a configured search provider.
//!
//! - Anthropic spells the version into the tool's own `type`, so the host may name one:
//!   `web_search_20250305` is basic search and `web_search_20260209` filters results with
//!   model-written code first. An unnamed or unknown version falls back to the basic one,
//!   because the SDK silently drops a provider tool it cannot map and the request would then
//!   go out with no search at all.
//! - Responses has no per-request max_uses parameter. The step driver still counts
//!   reported search calls and stops granting search across continuation requests.
//! - `openai-chat` and `openai-compatible` return `null`: Chat Completions has no
//!   provider-executed tool concept, and compatible providers discard those tools. The host can
//!   then return a recoverable rejection rather than silently skipping search.
